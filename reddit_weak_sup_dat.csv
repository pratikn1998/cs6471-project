This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

girlfriend has a pair of the MEE M6 pro - they're pretty cool, I like the sound especially w foam tips.

I'm actually kind of looking for cans this time around, but the thing is that I prefer an open back headphone with punch - something that has bass and a very ""live,"" fun sound but not something v shaped to the point where it's tiring to listen to. I prefer open back because of the sound stage.  I've tried ATH M50x's and they sounded really congested and bad to me.

The MSR7 don't isolate that well in loud environments.  The 1A would be better from that perspective, comfort, and provides more bass.

The Oppo PM3 and NAD VISIO HP50 are both good isolators, but I just saw your comment about how overpriced they are, plus the PM3 wouldn't have enough bass if you're worried about bass on the MSR7.

I've had a lot of portables and I think the 1A may be best for you, especially considering reasonable Japan prices.  The Momentums are really laid back up top, the the m50x are more v-shaped that the 1A.

d6ofntp,4yiamy,-0.333,"The M50x does have good noise isolation, but isolation doesn't help that well with low notes like an engine hum. Noise cancellation is different and does well with these low notes since they're predictable. I'd say it's still enough. I've used them on a plane and the noise that did leak through was tolerable. Having to pop my ears was more annoying.

Noise isolation is passively blocking sound while cancellation plays an inverse sound wave compared to the outside noise it picks up with its mic. The two waves cancel each other. Think like two ocean waves where the peak of one is at the trough of the other, both being the same distance from 0.

As it stands today I 100% am behind jailing parents who are the cause of others children who die due to their unvaccinated kids. If your child dies because you decided to not vaccinate then that's on you and I don't think you should be charged with anything. The loss of a child should be an eye opener and should weigh heavy on you.",changemyview,1,personally i would rather see vaccinations mandatory and also free nobody should be making money off of a way to provide health to others  if found guilty of not vaccinating then a fine will be issued if your unvaccinated child is the cause of death of another then the parent is charged with manslaughter  their is no reason why people shouldnt be vaccinated especially if it were free  as it stands today i 100 am behind jailing parents who are the cause of others children who die due to their unvaccinated kids if your child dies because you decided to not vaccinate then thats on you and i dont think you should be charged with anything the loss of a child should be an eye opener and should weigh heavy on you
dv8st3k,826qe4,0.167,What if they vaccinate but on a slightly delayed schedule? Are they guilty of manslaughter if it happens? What if they briefly couldn’t afford it and delayed for that reason? How much of the scheduling is itself actually based on empirical data?,changemyview,1,what if they vaccinate but on a slightly delayed schedule are they guilty of manslaughter if it happens what if they briefly couldnt afford it and delayed for that reason how much of the scheduling is itself actually based on empirical data
dv8t8uq,826qe4,0.083,"You cannot prove a negative.  That someone died because of a lack of vaccination, because no vaccine has ever proven to be 100% effective.

Also, it's very rare that someone dies because of whatever the vaccine is supposed to prevent.   People die because of the effects of an illness which have a myriad of causes and effects.  For example, AIDS doesn't kill people directly.  It's the effects AIDS has that causes other failures of the human system.

dv8vp6f,826qe4,0.104,"Prosecuting parents who refuse to vaccinate sounds reasonable but prosecuting people who spread disease through bad hygiene does not. Why would that be? A flu-bearing uncaught sneeze or unwashed hand is as dangerous to the immunocompromised as a poxed hippy child, and far more common, but the latter just seems worse.

Looking at it this way, a lot of this is about punishing people for holding the wrong opinion, the practical value is secondary. If it was about the practical value then real numbers would take centre stage in the argument rather than abstract musings about hypothetical children.",changemyview,1,prosecuting parents who refuse to vaccinate sounds reasonable but prosecuting people who spread disease through bad hygiene does not why would that be a flubearing uncaught sneeze or unwashed hand is as dangerous to the immunocompromised as a poxed hippy child and far more common but the latter just seems worse  looking at it this way a lot of this is about punishing people for holding the wrong opinion the practical value is secondary if it was about the practical value then real numbers would take centre stage in the argument rather than abstract musings about hypothetical children
