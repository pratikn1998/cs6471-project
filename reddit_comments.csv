(As an addendum: I also still definitely appreciate Catcher for what it is, and I'm glad I read it when I did. It's very well written and there's not really anything else quite like it, and it introduced me to a great author. So I will always have a special place in my heart for that book.)",AskReddit

Noah is almost wholeheartedly for releasing the salaries, probably at least in part because Immortals is a new VC-backed company. For Noah, it's better this than nothing and it seems like nothing is the only alternative.

Bryce also clearly favors the publicized player salaries, but is approaching it from a practical/experienced look. The salary information is only a drop in the bucket of information that players really need to properly evaluate themselves.

Marty seems staunchly against the release of player salaries because he sees them as too skewed, non-contextual, and inflammatory for the value they might provide to the players who need the information.

The MSR7 don't isolate that well in loud environments.  The 1A would be better from that perspective, comfort, and provides more bass.

The Oppo PM3 and NAD VISIO HP50 are both good isolators, but I just saw your comment about how overpriced they are, plus the PM3 wouldn't have enough bass if you're worried about bass on the MSR7.

Winning is about team performance. If your team isn't good you will still lose more than you win even if you are one of the most skilled players. You can be an insane player and lose.

Winning isn't an issue but it still means you are very likely to die less, have less ecos where yout chances of fragging are low, get more eco kills etc. Having good stats in a game you win, often even very clearly, is going to be a lot easier than when you are losing. ",GlobalOffensive

Being too big is not a problem, you can always divide the country into administrative subregions. If healthcare was administered at state level, the largest system would cover only 40m people. Smaller than each of Germany, UK, France, Italy and Spain. 

And you think each of these systems is completely centralised? I know UK operates the NHS through over 200 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) that comission the vast majority services at a local level.

The United States has an average longevity of 79.3 years. In the United Kingdom it's 81.2, or 1.9 years longer. Thus cursory analysis would show obesity differences account for about 19% of the total.

Of course this is ridiculous! And I’m not arguing it. But it’s in the same vein as your argument because breastfeeding does protect young babies and children. ",changemyview

It's hard to understand the minds of others, especially those devout religious types. I'm apatheistic, but it does seem that it is unfair on both sides. One way, your kid doesn't get to go to heaven, on the other you put people's lives at risk. It depends on your point of view.

If you let your kid play on the road and a car comes along and brakes in time, but still calls authorities you probably still get charged with criminally negligience, because of what could have happened.

So with this in mind could you explain why you want to see parents punished if their kid dies, but not if it merely gets infected or merely is under risk of infection? Shouldnt you ask to simply make vaccines mandatory?

All those are examples of parents not taking preventative steps to protect their children.

You're effectively trying to legislate parenting strategies.

What if parents want to teach their kids to be communists? What if they want to teach their kids to hate Jews (not tell them to do anything, just teach them to be anti-semetic)?

dv8p4xw,826qe4,0.292,If an antivaxxer's kid dies at the age of five from polio that is entirely the parents fault. However there is a certain price in blood we have to pay to live in a free society. The more control we hand over to the government to prevent an insignificant percentage of people from dieing just moves us closer to a police state. I think these people are killing their kids but I do not think we should put legislation in place to force government controlled vaccines on people. Government regulations aren't the solution to everything. In some areas regulations are absolutely needed but in most cases it wouldn't be a problem if we had a more educated population. We shouldn't solve issues with unneeded growth of governmental power if it can be solved through better means.,changemyview

If found guilty of not vaccinating then a fine will be issued. If your unvaccinated child is the cause of death of another, then the parent is charged with manslaughter.

Their is no reason why people shouldn't be vaccinated, especially if it we're free.

As it stands today I 100% am behind jailing parents who are the cause of others children who die due to their unvaccinated kids. If your child dies because you decided to not vaccinate then that's on you and I don't think you should be charged with anything. The loss of a child should be an eye opener and should weigh heavy on you.",changemyview

Also, it's very rare that someone dies because of whatever the vaccine is supposed to prevent.   People die because of the effects of an illness which have a myriad of causes and effects.  For example, AIDS doesn't kill people directly.  It's the effects AIDS has that causes other failures of the human system.
